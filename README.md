# PREDICTIVE_ANALYTICS_KNIME_PYTHON_ENTEGRATION
This project involves the implementation of machine learning models using knime and python integration.

Using the python extension in the knime analytics platform, all the following preprocessing operations are done in python and integrated into knime.

deletion of specific columns
Finding missing values
Function calculating mean values ​​for nan odometer values
Running calc_nanvalues_mean_func function for each line
Finding outliers and taking necessary actions
type conversion
one hot encoding
Application of all machine learning steps specified in knime and evaluation of models

data frame concatenation
rule based ro0w filpter
column filter
normalization,
Linear regression
random forest regression
gradient boosted trees regression
artificial neural networks
The following should be applied in Knime.

Updating the configurations of Excel Reader nodes by considering the file names of the data (part1, part2 ...). The data can be obtained from the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yY1wqTtXc3XV4muYzvu6Qk__oD-HGyYf
The Python environment configuration must be configured in Knime (File -> Preferences -> knime -> python). Knime
Adding the python exception. (File -> Install knime extensions)
